## About Me

My name is Jiachen Zhang 张佳辰. I often go by John, which sounds a lot like my Chinese last name, and also easier to pronounce. My birthplace is Lanzhou, China, a small city famous for its noodles. I moved to the United States when I was 13 years old for school, and I attended Emory University for my undergraduate studies. I majored in biology and Japanese, both of which I thoroughly enjoyed learning. I used to play tennis and bowling in high school and college, but now I just do it for fun. Outside of school, I had only one research experience, which was in a VA hospital. It was about how vascular dysfunction plays a role in Alzheimer's disease. We worked with RNA samples from transgenic mice. We examined the levels of vascular markers after transcribing them to DNA. My only statistical/data analysis experience was with basic R commands.



## Fun facts about me:

I love sparkling water.

I have 3 dogs at home.

I speak 3 languages: Chinese, English, and Japanese.
